Lời bài hát Used To It  Used To It - Joshua Bassett  | HoatHinh.tv | StdTJYb0qU6T Lyrics up by vnflix.com I'm not surprised you didn't call
When I almost died you didn't care at all
Mama said you can't be mad at who you wish somebody was
And I'm not surprised you didn't call
I guess I got used to it
You'd kiss me 'till I forget
You're covering up all your sins
I blame it on us being kids
I guess you had me convinced
It's my mind that's playing tricks
After all that you did, I won't admit it's you I miss
I guess I got used to it
I guess I got, I guess I got used to it
You told our friends you hope it hurts
You left me for him with one eye over your shoulder
Stab me in the back and I'm the one who's saying sorry again
You told our friends you're glad it hurts
I guess I got used to it
You'd kiss me 'till I forget
You're covering up all your sins
I blame it on us being kids
I guess you had me convinced
It's my mind that's playing tricks
After all that you did, I won't admit it's you I miss
I guess I got used to it
I guess I got, I guess I got
Tommy asked why I'm not mad
But you're the only love I've had
And I won't say what I can't take back, no
You did things I can't forgive
But mercy don't always make sense
And I'm the one who let you in again
I can't be mad
I let you treat me like that
I guess I got used to it
I guess I got used to it
You'd kiss me 'till I forget
You're covering up all your sins
I blame it on us being kids
I guess you had me convinced
It's my mind that's playing tricks
After all that you did, I won't admit it's you I miss
I guess I got used to it
I guess I got, I guess I got used to it
