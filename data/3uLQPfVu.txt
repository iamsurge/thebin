How to create an Automatic Backup from One Folder to Another Folder
BackUp.bat
robocopy "Folder A" "Folder B" /E
robocopy "Folder A" "Folder B" /E /MIR
robocopy "Folder A" "Folder B" /MIR + /E
robocopy "Folder A" "Folder B" /E /MIR /COPYALL /ZB /R:5 /W:8
robocopy "Folder A" "Folder B" /E /COPYALL /ZB /R:5 /W:8 /MOVE
robocopy "Folder A" "Folder B" /E /COPYALL /ZB /R:5 /W:8 /MOVE /MOT:1
--------------------------------------------------------------
This time instead of xcopy, we are using robocopy. Robocopy is the upgraded form of xcopy. Save the batch file with any name but don't keep the name as robocopy because it crashes the robocopy system.

/E This can copy all the files including subdirectories and empty directories.

/MIR can copy all the files including subdirectories and empty directories, delete destination files and directories that no longer exist in the source, and using the /MIR + /E option can overwrite the destination directory security settings.

/COPYALL copies file information such as data, attributes, time stamps, NTFS access control list, Owner information, and  Auditing information.

/ZB copies files in restartable mode. If file access is denied, it switches to backup mode.

/R:5 retries five times if runs into any issues.

/W:8 waits for 8 seconds between each of those (/R:5) five retries.

/COPYALL and /ZB require to run as administrator. 

Delete /MIR and add /MOV. We cannot use /MIR with /MOV and /MOVE.

/MOV can move the files but it will leave the source folder and subfolders empty after the files are moved. This can be pretty handy if you have assigned subfolders.

/MOVE moves the files and subdirectories completely to the destination folder and the source folder gets deleted. 

Using /MOT:1 together with /MOVE can help us to retain only the source after the files are moved to the destination. This can be useful if someone doesn't want to retain files and empty subfolders in the source.

The actual function of /MOT:1 is to monitor the source and run again in 1 minute if changes are detected.
