hello, rob, rich, and bill. the login page is now fixed. I noticed some of you trying to authenticate, and not getting the proper response. That was my bad, over worked and under payed. This pentest you three are on is of the utmost importance and cannot be delayed any longer.

Please refer to the ssh keys generated and published to pastebin in order to log into the server. and remember, do not share these keys with anyone... wouldnt want some script kiddie getting ahold of client data and leaking it to some hacker forum.
