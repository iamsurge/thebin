// Write a program that applies bonus score to given score in the range [1…9] by the following rules: * If the score is between 1 and 3,
// the program multiplies it by 10. * If the score is between 4 and 6, the program multiplies it by 100. * If the score is between 7 and 9,
// the program multiplies it by 1000. * If the score is 0 or more than 9, the program prints “invalid score”.
//
// Examples:
// score/result
// 2 	20
// 4 	400
// 9 	9000
// -1 	invalid score
// 10 	invalid score

//the program multiplies it by 10
//If the score is between 4 and 6,
//the program multiplies it by 100.
//If the score is between 7 and 9,
// the program multiplies it by 1000.
//If the score is 0 or more than 9
//the program prints “invalid score”
