The story so far
----------------
This game is about the real story of Baron Pacard Manford also known as PacMan* ! 
Baron Manford was a strange man! 
His skin was pale -almost yellow- he had a huge mouth and a huge appetite! He could eat anything. He especially loved yellow candy!
A less known aspect of his character was that the loved ghost stories. Since he was a little boy he liked exploring abandoned mansions which people thought they were haunted!
His exploring skills made him famous and people paid him to hunt ghosts in old abandoned mansions!
He even started his own company with two of his friends and named it "Ghostbusters inc". There was a movie that was based on this part of his life. It became an instant hollywood blockbuster. The movie name was -as you can imagine- "The three amigos". One of the Ghostbusting three amigos was the famous French explorer "Ultimate Play da Gam"! 
 During his travels, Ultimate Play Da Gam, learned that there was a big secret that noone knew and that secret would be revealed only to the bravest! The quest for this secret lead him to a haunted mansion with a big garden that belonged to Doctor Robbie Pssst. Dr Pssst research contained important information about the location and a map of a lost hidden mansion**! Ultimate Play Da Gam was the first man that mentioned that an "Ultimate Secret" exists!
 The combined intelligence of the French explorer, the Baron and the third unknown member of the team took Dr Robbie Pssst research of the prehistoric drawing even further. Their research led them in a haunted mansion that was close to the lost Count Dracula Gardens!
