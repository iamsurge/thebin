The Spy-Cicle
+ Removed holster penalty
+ On melt: gain +30 HP and 5 seconds of 75% debuff resistance
+ Reduced melt on-stab cooldown to 5 seconds
+ Reduced manual melt cooldown to 10 seconds
Previous incarnation was seen as too punishing with not enough reward for the trade-off. This seeks to improve the Spy's ability to slip away safety after melting the knife, also reducing its cooldowns to be more active.

- Reduced Health from Healers to -75%, penalty always active

Candy Cane
- Health from Healers penalty always active
Fixing a mistake.

Sappers
+ Radar range increased to 768 Hu
