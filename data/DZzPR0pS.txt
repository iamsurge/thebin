Lời bài hát Different  Different - Joshua Bassett  | HoatHinh.tv | gmi7GMyWrZN2 Lyrics up by vnflix.com Darlin', how I missed you, two years, not even friends
And I'm tryin' not to kiss you 'cause we've seen how this can end
And my therapist, would kill me if she knew that I was here
But no one knows me like you know me, dear
And no one holds me how you hold me, dear
I'm back in your arms, but everything's changed
Now we've been to hell and back again
My biggest regret, was walkin' away
I'm not gonna make the same mistake
I know you're afraid we'll end up the same
And the truth is we might, but if we do this thing right
Maybe this time it'll be different
Maybe this time it'll be different, different
Now I'm late to catch a red-eye, I didn't think we'd end up here
Yeah, I'm already on Cloud 9, don't wanna head back down the stairs
And I didn't think you'd kiss me, but I'm too in love to care
So kiss me slow before I go, my dear
I'm back in your arms, but everything's changed
Now we've been to hell and back again
My biggest regret was walkin' away
I'm not gonna make the same mistake
I know you're afraid we'll end up the same
And the truth is, we might, but if we do this thing right
Maybe this time it'll be different
Maybe this time it'll be different, different, mhm-mhm
Make me yours and I'm not leavin'
I know for sure you're all I needed
I can't believe I didn't see it
We took our time, the space we needed
I'm back in your arms, but everything's changed
(Make me yours and I'm not leavin')
Now we've been to hell and back again
(I know for sure you're all I needed)
My biggest regret was walkin' away
(Can't believe I didn't see it)
I'm not gonna make the same mistake
(We took our time, the space we needed)
I know you're afraid we'll end up the same
And the truth is we might, but if we do this thing right
Maybe this time it'll be different
Maybe this time it'll be different, different
