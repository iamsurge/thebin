-- I've seen a lot of beginners struggling to distinguish the differences between parameters and arguments. This is the case for many different languages so I am answering that question - 'What is the difference between parameters and arguments?'.


-- In programming, a parameter is a variable that is defined in a function definition. When a function is called, the values that are -- passed to the function as input are known as arguments.

-- For example, consider the following function definition:

function greet(name)
  print("Hello, " .. name .. "!")
end

-- In this function, name is a parameter. When the function is called, the value that is passed to the function as the name parameter is -- known as an argument. For example:

greet("Alice")  -- "Hello, Alice!"
greet("Bob")    -- "Hello, Bob!"

-- In both cases, the argument is a string that is passed to the greet function as the name parameter. The function uses the value of the -- name parameter to greet the user by name.

-- In summary, a parameter is a variable that is defined in a function definition, and an argument is a value that is passed to a function -- when it is called.
