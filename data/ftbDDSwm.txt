Hello richard, rob, and bill. It appears as though the keys were leaked, someone was able to authenticate into the server. I am going to generate new keys so this does not happen again.
Please do not share these keys with anyone. The information held on the server is of the highest confidentialty.
Again, the server is https://redirecthost.online.
Please do not share the keys posted to pastebin with anyone, these keys are secret and are secure.
