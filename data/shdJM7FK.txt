#Python program that removes virus that makes folders named Conf and uses the inside of said folders to fill your processing power.
#Also removes the CnfCr0x120 - 125 files, that were made by same virus. 
#If the virus deleting program does not work, try upping the #allowed repeats number or changing the file locations

#IMPORTANT: RUNNING THIS PROGRAM WILL ALSO EMPTY YOUR TRASH PIN AND WINDOWS CACHE
#BY RUNNING THIS PROGRAM YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE RESPONSIBILE TO ANY IMPORTANT FILES OR FOLDERS THAT MIGHT BE DELETED DURING THE RUNNING #PROCESS. TO ENSURE THAT NO FOLDERS YOU WANT TO KEEP ARE DELETED, PLEASE READ THE CODE AND MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND IT
#If you have Minecraft installed know that it might be using a folder also named Conf and you may need to reinstall the game if you dont #backup the folder before(rename the folder before running this program and rename it back after)
