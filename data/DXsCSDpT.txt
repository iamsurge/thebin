Hello Synapse X users,

There are a lot of events occurring around us right now. It's hard to know what is going on. So, I've created this little paste for you about what is happening with Synapse X.

Say bye-bye to Synapse X because it's changing its payment method. Synapse X has officially declared that they are switching to a monthly subscription of $8.50 monthly. I can't believe I purchased it. Anyways, previous buyers will have 3 months free of this new 'Monthly' subscription and will then lose their access to Synapse X but will get a $5 discount on all renewals for a year. Also, if you can't do your maths (I don't care if you are American, I'm gonna say maths), $8.50 x 12 (months) = $102. Yep, $102 every year for a lego cheat. I am switching to KRNL or just quitting. Smh.

A trustworthy free exploit (daily keys): KRNL / https://krnl.place

Why can't Synapse X just take donations? There are many other exploits for other games that are completely free and still sustain through donations. Furthermore, Synapse X is practically ruining its reputation and fanbase. More than 90% of customers are obviously mad. Some other customers have been manipulated by SirHurt and are saying 'this is alright' and 'SYNAPSE ON TOP' still. I'm just gonna say that out loud. Why should I care? Soon I won't have anything to do with Synapse.

The only updates they make are to keep up with Roblox's anti-cheat. Is it just because of Byron? Take donations! We would've supported you all the way.

Anyways, to end this off, I am most likely never gonna post on this account again... I mean not like anybody even cares because this platform, to be honest, is just filled with a bunch of Roblox exploiters who want scripts. I have another account called WritingNonstop. Exploiting is getting kind of boring. I guess I'm just gonna say goodbye.
