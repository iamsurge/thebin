Here is an example of how you could rewrite the ClientAccount class to use asynchronous methods and take advantage of the asynchronous capabilities of Dapper:

        public void AddDeal(decimal value)
        {

/*
This version of the ClientAccount class uses asynchronous methods provided by Dapper to perform database operations in an asynchronous manner. The ReadFromDatabaseAsync method can be used to asynchronously retrieve a ClientAccount object from the database using a given id, and the WriteToDatabaseAsync method can be used to asynchronously insert or update a ClientAccount object in the database.

By using asynchronous methods, you can improve the performance and scalability of your application by allowing it to make better use of available resources and avoid blocking threads. However, it is important to note that asynchronous programming can be more complex than synchronous programming, and you may need to carefully consider the trade-offs between the two approaches.
