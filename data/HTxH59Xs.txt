Is rampant, unchecked illegal emmigration to the U.S. a rightwing myth?

Many things are myths when one digs a bit deeper. Despite what I heard on the news, online, and everywhere else, the STEM crisis is a myth. I learned this from IEEE Spectrum. Upon further investigation, I found that the U.S. Bureau of Labor of Statistics confirmed IEEE's findings, with one large exception: Petroleum engineers. We have a shortage. BLS suggested that the root cause is climate change. As a result, we must import them from other countries who do not have climate change. Ample numbers of petroleum engineers exist abroad, as well as the university engineering programs to educate them. I suspect there is a similar situation for material scientists and rare earth metal mining and refining expertise. 

<h3>Let's find out about illegal immigration</h3>
As of 9 September 2022, there were 2 million encounters on the United States southern border during FY2022. Of those, 920,000  resulted in Title 42 expulsions. Title 42 is a public health law, extant for 100 years. Title 42 was invoked in 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, not because Orange Man Bad. That leaves us with 1,080,000 illegal aliens.

<code>2000000 - 920000 = 1080000</code> 

Fox says that 913,000 of the remaining 1.08 million illegal aliens are allowed long-term residence in the United States under Title 8.

<h4>What is Title 8?</h4>
Title 8 is a U.S. alien entry and asylum law. The Federal Register announced revisions to it on 22 September 2022. The revisions weaken Title 8. Specifically, they allow less stringent checks for past felony convictions and a faster track for monetary assistance and work permits. "Faster track" means that the waiting period used to be 350 days, but is now 150 days.

We are told that most of these 913,000 alien entrants show up for their screenings, court dates, and are then granted asylum. That is to say, they don't go to a sanctuary city in California, Virginia, or Massachusetts and work illegally/ under the table, nor receive state-funded public assistance in perpetuity despite being an undocumented migrant. Democrats claim that a full 95% DO go through the full process to be granted asylum, and thus are not deported by ICE of the Deparment of Homeland Security. 

Keep in mind that sanctuary cities throughout the U.S. have been actively impeding ICE for over a decade. Denver and San Francisco revoked the 100 year-old health law against public defecation for the express purpose of protecting their resident undocumented migrants. How so? Many were habitually defecating in public and getting arrested by local police. Police would quickly determine their illegal alien status and contact ICE to pick them up for deportation. City governments addresseed the root cause by sacrificing public hygiene. Even U.S. Federal judges have participated in subverting federal law enforcement because they deem it so essential to protect and retain their publicly defecating, non-English speaking, illiterate, sometimes drug cartel member illegal alien residents. This has the real-world effect of strengthening Democrat, Koch brother (the other one died), and Cato Institute claims--yes, I am looking at you Professor Bryan Caplan--that very few Title 8 entrants need to be deported by ICE.

<h4>The 95%</h4>
Democrats state that merely 5% are later deported, implying that a full 95% of the caravans of people who are released into the United States are law-abiding, appear for their immigration screenings and court dates, and are determined to be legitimate asylum seekers from repressive regimes. I recall a proud 19 year old woman announcing that she had attended U.S. public schools from 1st grade through high school, then was admitted--with a full needs-based scholarship--to a taxpayer-funded, land grant, four year public university in Texas, and was STILL undocumented. She was widely praised on Twitter for her bravery. I believe that President Obama bequeathed her and other individuals with the moniker of Dreamers. Who can deny a Dreamer?  

<code>1080000 * 0.95 = 945000</code> 

So, 95% of the Title 8 entrants were allowed to remain legally in the U.S. That is 945,000 legal "asylum seekers" who entered under the auspices of the Biden administration in just 9 months, while Title 42 was in effect! Fox says that the count is 913,000 without the caveat that all have satisfied provisions of Title 8. 

TOBE CONTINUED HERE math is wrong

But wait, there's more. That's only 913K plus 920K equals 1.833 M of the 2 M initially detained at our southern border. Another 17K are unaccounted for. Grand total is 839,000 Ecuadorean, Haitian, Venezuelan, and others who have been absorbed into the U.S. in less than a year.

--------------------------------
The number of migrant encounters at the southern border has smashed through the two million mark this fiscal year, breaching the already-historic 1.7 million encounters last year â€” but those numbers by themselves do not state how have been released into the U.S., or account for hundreds of thousands of others who have slipped past Border Patrol.
There have been more than two million migrant encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border in FY2022, as Border Patrol agents deal with a migrant crisis unprecedented in U.S. history and one that the Biden administration has so far failed to slow, despite its claims that the border is "secure."
However, the encounters can include multiple attempts by the same migrants. Additionally, nearly half of the encounters have resulted in an expulsion under Title 42, implemented in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of those expelled will make multiple efforts to cross the border, resulting in multiple encounters with Border Patrol. So far this fiscal year, over 920,000 encounters have resulted in a Title 42 expulsion, according to Customs and Border Protection (CBP), with about the same number (912,575) processed under what is known as Title 8. However, some will be transferred straight into Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody; others can be returned via voluntary return or expedited removal if they either do not claim asylum or do not pass an initial asylum screening.

-----------------------
No, there have been 2.2 million who entered the US on supposed cases of asylum since late January 2021 via our southern border. They come from Venezuela or El Salvador. (The president of Mexico is a good man. He wants to iimprove quality of life and reduce corruption, so that his nation's citizens choose to stay.) 
Those 2.2 million are resettled here at the US taxpayer's expense. Most are in my state or the 2 to my east. Presidents Obama and Trump cared about America's borders. We had 11 mil illegal aliens total, from 2008 - 2017. In just 2 years, that has increased by 20 percent. How close do YOU live to Douglas or Las Cruces or El Paso? It is my home.
