Lời bài hát Prom Queen  Prom Queen - Beach Bunny  | HoatHinh.tv | 2tuYXD7GLTCe Lyrics up by vnflix.com [Verse 1]
Shut up, count your calories
I never look good in mom jeans
Wish I was like you
Blue-eyed blondie, perfect body

[Chorus 1]
Maybe I should try harder
You should lower your expectations
I'm no Quick-Curl Barbie
I was never *** out for Prom Queen

[Post-Chorus]
If I get more pretty, do you think he will like me?

[Verse 2]
Dissect my insecurities
I'm a defect surgical project
It's getting hard to breathe
There's plastic wrap in my cheeks

[Chorus 2]
Maybe I should try harder
You should lower your beauty standards
I'm no Quick-Curl Barbie
I was never *** out for Prom Queen

[Bridge]
If I'm pretty, will you like me?
They say beauty makes boys happy
I've been starving myself, carving
Skin until my bones are showing

[Outro]
Teach me how to be okay
I don't want to downplay my emotions
They say beauty is pain
You'll only be happy
If you look a certain way
I wanna be okay
I wanna be okay
