    <description>The carrier of this gene was engineered for extremely efficiency in a growth vat, allowing them to be printed from an embryo farm, grown to adulthood, and sent into battle in just a few days.  They originate from war-torn worlds where the only way to maintain military strength is to print new soldiers as fast as they are killed.  However, the changes to their metabolism place considerable strain on their cellular structure, reducing their natural lifespan considerably and drastically reducing their capacity for acquiring new skills.  They are also, by design, entirely sterile.</description>

      <!-- Growth vat by default is 20x, so 18 years (1080 days) takes 54 days.  18x multiplier on speed reduces that to 3 days.  If they also have the growth vat essential meme, they'll get another 30% bonus on top of this, reducing the growth time to 2.31 days, or slightly under 56 hours. -->
