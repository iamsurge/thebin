# Webinar Input Patterns Nov 12 2022

# input() ALWAYS returns a string
# myInput = input()
#
# but we might want to change it to something else...

# 1 Turn a numeric string into an int or float
# 2 Breaking up a long string into a list of smaller strings
# 3 Break up a string containing numeric chars into a list of
#       recast ints or floats
# 4 One value tells you how many times to call input()
# 5 We DON'T KNOW how many times to call input(), but we know
#       a sentinel value to stop

# 1 Turn a numeric string into an int or float
# myInput = input()
# myInput = "5" # input()
# myInput = int(input()) # float(input())... int(input().strip())

# 2 Breaking up a long string into a list of smaller strings
# myInput = input()
# myInput = "Pat Silly Doe"
# strList = myInput.split()
# print(strList)

# 3 Break up a string containing numeric chars into a list of
#       recast ints or floats
# Lab 28.11... 10 5 3 21 2
# myInput = "31 333 2 78 92"
# strList = myInput.split()
# print(strList)
# numList = []
# for num in strList:
#     numList.append(int(num))
#
#
# # You could do this as a LIST COMPREHENSION
# # [expression for item in other container]
# numList = [int(num) for num in strList]
# print(numList)


#4 One value tells you HOW MANY TIMES to call input()
# like Lab 6.17
# ... inputs:
# 5
# 30.0
# 50.0
# 10.0
# 100.0
# 65.0

# numValues = int(input())
# numValues = 5
# floatValues = []
#
# for n in range(numValues): # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
#     nextInput = float(input())
#     floatValues.append(nextInput)
# print(floatValues)


# 5 We DON'T KNOW how many times to call input(), but we know to stop on some SENTINEL VALUE
# Lab 33.15

# -1

# ask for the FIRST input()
myInput = input()
# THEN we can loop...
while myInput != "-1": # not the int -1 but the str "-1"... our loop will not ever stop if we're testing the wrong one!!!
    # do our stuff

    myInput = input() # last in loop, grab input for next iteration

# multiple quit commands
# Done, done, d, quit
# while myInput != "Done" and myInput != "done" and myInput != "d":
quitCommands = ["Done", "done", "d", "quit"]
while not myInput in quitCommands:
    # do your stuff
    myInput = input()
