So, when his teacher told the class about a secret garden hidden within the school, Robbie was determined to find it. He spent days searching for the garden, but to no avail. Finally, he asked the janitor for help. The janitor told Robbie that the garden was only for special people and that he wasn't allowed to go there. Robbie was disappointed, but he didn't give up. He was determined to find a way into the garden.
One day, Robbie found a key hidden in the janitor's closet. He was sure that this key would unlock the door to the secret garden. But when he tried it, the key didn't fit. Robbie was crushed. He thought he would never find the garden.
But then he had an idea. He would make his own garden! He started digging in the school yard and planting flowers. Soon, he had created his own little oasis. And he was the only one who knew about it. It was his very own secret garden.
