# The total magnification of a microscope can be calculated using the equation: eyepiece lens magnification Ã— objective lens magnification.

# Get the magnification of the eyepiece lens.
eyepiece_lens = float(input('Enter the magnification of the eyepiece lens: '))
# Get the magnification of the objective lens.
objective_lens = float(input('Enter the magnification of the objective lens: '))
# Calculate the total magnification.
total_magnification = eyepiece_lens * objective_lens
# Display the total magnification.
print('The total magnification is', total_magnification)
