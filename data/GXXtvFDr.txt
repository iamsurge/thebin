-- This program will chop down a tree using a turtle

-- First, move the turtle to the base of the tree
turtle.forward()

-- Then, dig the block below the turtle until it is standing on top of the trunk of the tree
while turtle.detectDown() do
  turtle.digDown()
  turtle.down()
end

-- Next, chop down the tree by digging blocks above the turtle
while turtle.detect() do
  turtle.dig()
  turtle.up()
end

-- Finally, move the turtle back to the ground
while turtle.detectDown() == false do
