Sandman
+ Removed recharge penalty
Increase in recharge appeared to be an overcorrection for the reduced effect time given.

The Classic
+ Added +50% clip size
Due to the slower nature of the weapon, it was given a larger clip to make up for the increased downtime reloading introduces.

Sydney Sleeper
+ Headshots increase jarate duration by 2 seconds instead of 1 (4 seconds max)
Make the weapon slightly more rewarding on headshots to reward its supportive utility.

Hitman's Heatmaker
+ FOCUS mode draws ammo from reserve rather than clip
- Removed reload bonus during FOCUS mode
Makes the FOCUS more potent for bypassing the need to reload.

Manmelter
+ Removed damage penalty
The reduced damage appeared to make the flares noticeably less effective and crits less rewarding. The reduced afterburn time should help to make the damage output less potent for the increased ability to gain crits.

Phlogistinator
~ Alt-Fire can interrupt Primary Fire
+ Alt-Fire now extinguishes teammates, returning 10% MMMPH charge
+ MMMPH taunt (and invincibility) speed increased by 50%
+ MMMPH charge increases damage by 15%
- Minicrits when it would normally crit (not just when healed)
The intent is to make the MMMPH charge less polarizing offensively without totally neutering it, while also returning the utility of the Flamethrower and making the charge more readily available.

Syringe Guns
- Projectile behavior reverted while alternative solutions are worked on
These modified projectiles were not behaving consistently, bouncing off players and requiring excessive collision checks. An alternative is being worked to more simply achieve the goals.

Server
+ Reactivated voting from "Call Vote" in the menu for Scramble Vote and Next Map
- Removed Bot Overhaul mod as it was causing issues with disappearing weapons
