Spy Attributes
+ Reduced time to cloak to 1.5s
The former speed appeared to be an unfair trade-off for the added health.

Sappers
+ Spy radar highlights enemy buildings in range
A piece of intel that would be additionally helpful for your team seemed fitting for this feature.

Spy-Cicle
- Increased on-stab knife durability loss to 67%
The former durability loss did not seem to be so impactful, this version should make 2-3 stabs in quick succession enough to melt the knife.

Conniver's Kunai
+ Reduced max health penalty to -45
+ Removed faster overheal decay
- Decreased max health cap to 190 (x2)
- Reduced minimum health on backstab to 45
- Reduced health gain speed to 120/s
Trying again to massage the stats of this weapon into a less extreme and more tolerable state, primarily making sure the health reward isn't instantaneous and reducing the minimum health gained to make picking out targets to stab more important in order to gain back more HP.

Panic Attack
+ Added 33% faster firing speed
- Added -34% clip size penalty
~ Upon firing, the entire clip is dumped and can't be cancelled
This intends to merge the old sneeze gun design with the current version. While the user can quickly dump a lot of potential damage, it should be offset by being forced into dealing with the growing spread with each consecutive shot.

Reserve Shooter
+ Added 25% accuracy bonus
- Increased clip size penalty to -50%
An attempt to differentiate the weapon a bit more and give it additional boon that may attract pyros, increasing it's effective range and making the airshots with it on soldier a bit easier to make effective, at the cost of less sustained fire.

Miniguns
+ Reduced base spin-down time to 50% of base spin-up time
A change to further synergize with Heavy's shotguns and melees to make them more viable when falling back, and to soften the blow when caught out of position.
