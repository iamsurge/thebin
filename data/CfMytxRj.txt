Hah
Uhmmmmm

[Lia, Yeji]
Why you calling me up
Saying sorry again
Already told you we're done
What didn't you get?
Don't forget you're the one
That tried to get with my friends
The end the end the end the end

[Ryujin, Yuna]
Well you must be going crazy
Thinking I'll be back, I'm sorry
Cause you're crying like a baby
But do I look like your mommy?
Take a look into that mirror
If you wonder why you lost me
Gotta sit down and shut up
You did it to yourself

[Lia, Chaeryeong, Yuna, Yeji]
Boy, gonna *** me? Boy, I'm so pissed
Boy, gonna miss me, Boy, you're dismissed
Cuz I don't fall for boys like you
(I don't fall for)
I don't fall for boys like you
(I don't fall for)
Boy, wanna date me? Boy, outta date, yeah
Boy, wanna "What? No!" Boy, outta my way
Cuz I don't fall for boys like you
(I don't fall for)
I don't fall for boys like you
(I don't fall for)

[Chaeryeong, Lia]
I see through sweet little lies
And every excuse
When you start every fight
The blame is on you
One red flag and I'm gone already onto
The next the next the next

[Yuna, Ryujin]
Well you must be going crazy
Thinking I'll be back, I'm sorry
Cause you're crying like a baby
But do I look like your mommy?
Take a look into that mirror
If you wonder why you lost me
Gotta sit down and shut up
You did it to yourself

[Yeji, Lia, Ryujin, Chaeryeong]
Boy, gonna *** me? Boy, I'm so pissed
Boy, gonna miss me, Boy, you're dismissed
Cuz I don't fall for boys like you
(I don't fall for)
I don't fall for boys like you
(I don't fall for)
Boy, wanna date me? Boy, outta date, yeah
Boy, wanna "What? No!" Boy, outta my way
Cuz I don't fall for boys like you
(I don't fall for)
I don't fall for boys like you
(I don't fall for)

[Yeji, Chaeryeong]
You can raise your voice
But know that you have no choice
Don't care what you do
(You-uhhhhhhhh)
You can raise your voice
But know that you have no choice
Don't care what you do
(You-uhhhhhhhh)

[Lia, Chaeryeong]
So turn around, walk away
You made ur bed, so u gotta lay
Get outta my way

[Ryujin, Yeji, Yuna, Chaeryeong]
Boy, gonna *** me? Boy, I'm so pissed
Boy, gonna miss me, Boy, you're dismissed
Cuz I don't fall for boys like you
(I don't fall for)
I don't fall for boys like you
(I don't fall for)
Boy, wanna date me? Boy, outta date, yeah
Boy, wanna "What? No!" Boy, outta my way
Cuz I don't fall for boys like you
