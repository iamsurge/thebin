Lời bài hát Sad Songs In A Hotel Room  Sad Songs In A Hotel Room - Joshua Bassett  | HoatHinh.tv | o7ZMrvw3ty8e Lyrics up by vnflix.com I'm wearing the robe
The same ones we left on the hotel floor
Just one year ago
'Do not disturb' hanging on the door
How the hell we end up where we did?
Don't you think it's messed up, it all went to ***
It's kinda depressing being here alone
I miss you so I pick up the phone
And I order room service for one
Champagne mini-bar bottles are done
I've got a balcony room with a view
Velvet curtains are closed
I'm singing sad songs in a hotel room, ooh
Where I once held you
I'm singing sad songs in a hotel room, hmm
The neighbors are knocking, they just wanna sleep
It's 3 am while my guitar gently weeps
I flip through these old magazines
Dream destinations we promised we'd see, oh-oh-oh
How the hell we end up where we did?
In one year it all went to ***
So I order room service for one
Champagne mini-bar bottles are done
I've got a balcony room with a view
Velvet curtains are closed
I'm singing sad songs in a hotel room, ooh
Where I once held you
I'm singing sad songs in a hotel room, hmm
A-a-ah, oh-oh-oh-oh
We checked in together
I never checked out
Guess it's heartbreak hotel
'Cause just look at us now
Oh, I order room service for one
Champagne mini-bar bottles are done
I've got a balcony room with a view
Velvet curtains are closed
I'm singing sad songs in a hotel room, ooh
Where I once held you
I'm singing sad songs in a hotel room
