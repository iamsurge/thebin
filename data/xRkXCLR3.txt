Some notes in response to Quora question, <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-T-S-Eliot-was-anti-Semitic">Was T.S. Eliot anti-Semitc</a>? and answer by <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Alex-Johnston-39">Alex Johnston</a>, see here <a href="https://qr.ae/pr1krv">Alex Johnston's answer</a>.

My intent is to develop this into an answer of my own. <br />
I am Jewish. I also am very fond of Prufrock and Four Quartets. Professor Andrew Gelman (/topic/Andrew-Gelman-2) [is the Gelman topic about Columbia political science professor or someone else in Quora land? Check!] considers Eliot to be both a fascist and anti-Semite. I have found a preponderance of evidence that Eliot was not a supporter of fascism in WW2 nor later. Gelman might be right about the anti-Semitism though he mostly ridicules Eliot. In 1985, The New York Times wrote this about T.S. Eliot and anti-Semitism.
