Me: In a different random language, write a trivia game about the Discworld in 50 lines or less.
OpenAI: Here is a randomly-selected programming language: Java. And here is a trivia game about the Discworld written in Java in 50 lines or less: [Code below]
OpenAI: This code defines an array of trivia questions and answers, and then presents each question to the user, allowing them to enter their answer. The code then checks the user's answer and increments their score if it is correct. At the end, the code displays the user's final score.

Me: what are some more questions you could add to the java one?
OpenAI: Here are some additional questions that could be added to the Discworld trivia game written in Java:
    Who is the Discworld's equivalent of the god Odin?

    Who is the Discworld's equivalent of the god Uranus?
    Who is the Discworld's equivalent of the god Neptune?
    Who is the Discworld's equivalent of the god Pluto?
OpenAI: To add these questions to the game, they could be added to the questions array in the same format as the existing questions.
