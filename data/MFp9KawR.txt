Cherry Blossom

Japanese scientists have invented a new type of cherry tree that blossoms in blue. However, due to gene modification the tree is very sensitive to weather conditions - expected blossom date is always in March, but sometimes the trees blossom in February, and sometimes in April. That's why scientists had to develop a set of rules to predict the exact date the cherry tree will blossom. There are several factors to account for: winter length, rain quantity during blossom season, average temperature and the expected blossom day.

Here are how these factors affect the blossom process - each week of the winter will cause the cherry tree to blossom one day later that the expected blossom date. The optimal average temperature is 20. Each degree over that will cause the tree to blossom one day earlier, and each degree below what will cause the tree to blossom one day later. Optimal rain is 30cm, each 3 cm below or over will cause the tree to blossom one day later. And on leap years average temperature is 5 degrees over the expected temperature.

Following these instruction and given the expected blossom date your task is to find the exact date the tree will blossom.
