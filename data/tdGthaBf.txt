# Me: Randomly select a programming language. In that language, in 50 lines or less, write a trivia game.
#
# AI: Here is a randomly-selected programming language: Python
# And here is a trivia game written in Python in 50 lines or less: [code below]
# This code defines a list of trivia questions and answers, shuffles the list, 
# and then presents each question to the user, allowing them to choose an answer
# from a list of options. The code then checks the user's answer and increments
# their score if it is correct. At the end, the code displays the user's final score.
