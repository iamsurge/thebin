Write state-of-the-art python algorithm that finds out if given graph is Hamiltonian

# This algorithm is known as Hierholzer's Algorithm.

# This algorithm is used to determine whether a given graph is Hamiltonian or not.

# The algorithm works in the following way:

# Step 1: Choose any vertex in the graph and traverse the graph until all the vertices have been visited.

# Step 2: If at any point, the vertex has already been visited, then backtrack and try another vertex.

# Step 3: If all the vertices have been visited, then the graph is Hamiltonian.

# Step 4: If all the vertices have not been visited, then the graph is not Hamiltonian.
