<strong> What is the difference between TrueNat and RT PCR?</strong>
<p >Both RT PCR and TrueNat require nasal or oral swabs for samples but use very different procedures to draw results. This leads to a substantial time difference in report availability.</p>
<p >RT PCR, the most often used Covid-19 test uses the one-step "reverse transcription" testing method where the Covid-19 virus' RNA is converted into DNA to ascertain the presence of Covid-19 virus in the test sample taken from the patients. RT PCR reports are available within 9 hours.</p>
<p >TrueNat is a chip-based automated test that uses the nasal and oral swab to determine the presence of the virus in the sample. It's much faster than RT PCR. The test report is available within half an hour.</p>
<p >RT PCR requires a complete laboratory set up while TrueNat is a portable device and can be used in remote locations as well.</p>
<p >Between the two, RT PCR is more reliable in the detection of the Covid-19 virus.</p>
