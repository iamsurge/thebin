CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:74 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindLibObs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "LibObs", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "LibObs" with any
  of the following names:

    LibObsConfig.cmake
    libobs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "LibObs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "LibObs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "LibObs"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
