Buddah bless this beat
You likin' what you see
Everything designer, that's on me, uh
That's water when I walk
Looking like you, just tryna f-, yeah
This drip got you in heat
Just jump in, baby girl, hop on this d-, yeah
You know that I'ma beat (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
All this drip got your a- in heat, yeah
'Cause that's some kind of love, no
Girl I know that you hate it
Girl I'm not gonna let you down
I ain't gon' keep you waitin' up
If you throw it, it's gon' get knocked up
You playin' hide and seek, I'ma find you (I'ma find you)
Baby, hold on tight when you ride me (Ride me)
You know I like to eat, give me options
If you throw it, it's gon' get knocked up
I wanna get equal
All that a- for my ego
Baby, we gon' keep it simple
I need all that love on me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You likin' what you see

All this drip got your a- in heat, yeah
This drip got you in heat (This drip got you in heat)
Super wet, her juice is runnin' down her knee, uh
No stylist, in the celine (No stylist)
Got you flashing with that icy, better believe, yeah
Pretty pies inside the mansion by the beach (Beach)
Let me press all on you bathing suit your style is so unique
Bands inside your whole designer, dramas for the week
And that's all on me
I swear, that's all on me (It's all on me)
You actin' you really want it
You gon' get it
Plus, I'll f- you good, I got you (Got you)
In you feelings (Feelings)
Birkin bags and Goyards pouches (Pouches)
Got you dripping (Dripping)
Calculus and more accountants (Accountants)
Countin' digits (Digits)
Cherishin' these riches
You likin' what you see
Everything designer, that's on me, uh
That's water when I walk
Looking like you, just tryna f-, yeah
This drip got you in heat
Just jump in, baby girl, hop on this d-, yeah
You know that I'ma beat (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
All this drip got your a- in heat, yeah
Give me directions, I do whatever you want (Whatever you want)
Got a fifth of that Hen' just to add to the fun (To add to the fun)
You light it up while I'm breakin' you down
You gon' knock out by the end of this round
You got me speechless, girl, that p-no pole (That p- no pole)
Girl, you're the only one that knows what I want (Knows what I want)
I'm feeling this s-, I know you're feeling it too (Feeling it too)
I can go deeper, but it's all up to you, yeah
I wanna get equal
All that a- for my ego
Baby, we gon' keep it simple
I need all that love on me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You likin' what you see
Everything designer, that's on me, uh
That's water when I walk
Looking like you, just tryna f-, yeah
This drip got you in heat
Just jump in, baby girl, hop on this d-, yeah
You know that I'ma beat (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
All this drip got your a- in heat, yeah
