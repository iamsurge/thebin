Lời bài hát An Ode To A Spouse  An Ode To A Spouse - Russ Abbott  | HoatHinh.tv | ikzMDNdu204X Lyrics up by vnflix.com Your mom is out at work
Now she's got a job
We miss the love and touch around the house
She was right you're mold and an end fault
I'd rather be a man than be a spouse
 
(Come on, look what I've got)
 
And stop there, your gran is in bed
So keep the noise down, will ya
Wipe your feet, blow your nose, I'm trying to cook
the dinner
Give me a pan, I'll open a can
and you can set the table
butter the bread
make it spread
This can has got no label
 
Your moms is out at work
Now she's got a job
We miss the love and touch around the house
She was right you're mold and an end fault
I'd rather be a man than be a spouse
 
(Got me rubbing the chairs)
 
You can wash and you can dry
And don't you answer back
Mind your lip I warned you
I'll keep you such a crack
Feed the dog, fetch a log
I forgot we've got central heating
And into the shop you can't have sweets
That's all you seem to be yeeting
 
Your mom is out at work
Now she's got a job
We miss the love and touch around the house
She was right you're mold and an end fault
I'd rather be a man than be a spouse
 
(Hold your sticky fingers, will ya?)
 
Where you off, don't be late
You've got school in the morning
You've got exams, you've got to pas
I'm giving you a warning
Feed the baby, use a spoon
Remember she's your sister
Your mom's got a job from 9 to 5
And boy how we missed her
 
Your mom is out at work
Now she's got a job
We miss the love and touch around the house
She was right you're mold and an end fault
I'd rather be a man than be a spouse
 
I'll tell you something alright
There's a moral
to this story
And I'll try to keep it brief
I hope your mother gets the sack
It will be such a great relief
 
Your mom's out at work
Now she's got a job
We miss the love and touch around the house
She was right you're mold and an end fault
I'd rather be a man
I'd rather be a man
I'd rather be a man than be a spouse!!!
