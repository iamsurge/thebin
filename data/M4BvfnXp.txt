Equalizer
~ Restored kill icon
Eyelander
~ Fixed tracking of decapitations
Loch-n-Load
~ Fixed issue with reloading at once
General fixes to weapons so they function properly

Liberty Launcher
- Added -10% explosion radius
A slight nerf on the blast radius makes the faster firing and traveling rockets require more accuracy.

Scorch Shot
+ Removed self damage force penalty
This attribute was unnecessary in its current state. Without it, the pyro could setup some delayed jumps with the flare, distinct enough the Det's jumps

Southern Hospitality
+ Increased dispenser range bonus to 450%
+ Reduced building cost by 25%
+ Removed slower sentry build speed
+ Removed upgrade rate penalty
- Removed increased metal from pickups
- 75% max metal on wearer
Prior stats for the weapons were rather excessive and somewhat at odds for the intended usage. The intent here is to make it better for more static holds centered around a boosted dispenser, with less metal capacity requiring the engineer to play around their dispenser and team more to take advantage of it.

Buildings
+ Increased building speed of Dispensers & Teleporters by 100%
Setting up support structures for the engineer was often very difficult in faster game modes, so simply matching the sentry build speed should help to allow engineers to keep up.
