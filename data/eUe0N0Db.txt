Lời bài hát Don't Change My Luck  Don't Change My Luck - Suzi Quatro  | HoatHinh.tv | DgXZIrakKuA1 Lyrics up by vnflix.com Well you may not have his points of view
But as a matter of fact I think you're downright rude
To take some people apart the way you do
So here we are sitting in this retaurant
And I'm so tired of hearing about what you want
Or maybe you've forgotten just who you're talking to
Well for three long years I was waiting to hear
Just a few words from you that were vaguely sincere
It certainly is going to be easy forgetting about you
So if you don't mind, I'll simply explain
That I've found someone new and I'm living again
And the last thing I need is your sympathy
But try to understand, and please don't keep putting him down

Don't change my luck
I'm so tired of being moved around
Don't change my luck
Well for three long years I was on my own
Now I've finally found him
Baby don't change my luck
Now that I've found him
Please don't change my luck

Oh there were so many times I was ready to leave
And for so many reasons that you'd never believe
I stuck around like the fool you thought me to be
And I can't help it if you don't understand
And I won't take the blame, but baby you can
And anyway, it's time you learned a few things about me
Oh yes baby this is really the end
And when I walk out of here you won't see me again
And this time I'm taking my life with me
So please baby please, please don't keep hanging around

Don't change my luck
I'm so tired of being moved around
Don't change my luck
Well for three long years I was on my own
Now I've finally found him
Baby don't change my luck
Now that I've found him
Please don't change my luck
Now that I've found him
Baby don't change my luck
Baby don't change my luck
Please don't change my luck
Baby don't change my luck
